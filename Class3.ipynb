    "In this section, we will discuss the importance of keeping code and text tidy and provide an overview of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Importance of Keeping Code and Text Tidy\n",
    "Maintaining a clean and organized codebase is crucial for various reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability**: Tidy code is easier to read and understand, not only for you but also for others who might work with your code in the future. Good readability is essential for effective collaboration and reduces the likelihood of introducing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: When your code is well-organized, it becomes easier to maintain and extend. Adhering to coding conventions and best practices reduces the complexity of the code and makes it easier to identify and fix bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Writing clean and modular code promotes reusability, which in turn reduces redundancy and development time. Code that is easy to understand and modify can be easily reused in other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Tidy code, along with clear and concise documentation, makes it easier for others to learn and understand your work. This is particularly important when sharing your projects with the community or when seeking help from others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Overview of the Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial will cover three main topics related to keeping your code and text tidy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python Coding Conventions**: We will discuss Python's official style guide (PEP 8) and best practices for code organization and readability. We will also introduce popular linters and formatters to help you maintain clean code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Version Control with Git**: We will introduce version control concepts and explore how to use Git for managing your codebase. We will cover basic Git commands, working with branches, remote repositories, and best practices for workflow and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Document Formatting using TeX**: We will introduce TeX and LaTeX for creating professional documents and explore their basic structure, formatting options, and best practices for organizing and structuring LaTeX projects.\n",
    "\n",
